# Shelter Occupancy Analysis

This project analyzes the factors influencing homeless shelter occupancy in Los Angeles and peer US cities. The analysis examines demographic patterns, seasonality and weather, economic pressures, and government funding to better understand what drives shelter utilization.

## Project Context
This analysis was completed as part of a graduate capstone project in Business Analytics. This repository contains my individual contributions and a reproduced version of the analysis.

## Data Sources
- Homeless shelter occupancy and capacity data (2023–2025)
- Los Angeles HHAP funding data
- Census-based rent burden and poverty indicators
- Shelter-level operational and environmental data

## Tools Used
- R
- Excel
- Data visualization libraries

## Key Insights
- Shelter occupancy is not driven by demographics or weather alone
- Housing affordability pressures and funding execution play a larger role
- Effective resource deployment is critical for improving system performance
